# SQL-HackerRank

I earned the Gold Badge for SQL on HackerRank. It is an interactive platform to learn and expand your skillset while getting an opportunity to solve a variety of interesting challenges.

Through this badge, I was able to practice Basic to advance and alternative queries. Its a good platform to practice if one wishes to brush up or just wishes to start exploring SQL.
